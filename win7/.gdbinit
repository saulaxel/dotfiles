# Win 7 32 bits requires weird adjustments, like a debugger not showing
# std::string beyond it's memory adresses.

# - Code::Blocks 17 works, but shipped old gdb cannot use python pretty printers THAT COME WITH IT.
# - Newer gdb understands python pretty printers, but doesn't ship them

# Solution: Use .gdbinit to tell the modern gdb where are Code::Blocks' pretty printers.
